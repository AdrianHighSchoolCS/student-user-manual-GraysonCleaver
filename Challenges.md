## Challenges
<p><b>I'm great at many things but I struggle with... Getting started in the tasks at hand. After that, it usually goes well.</b></p> 
<p>Things that will break my focus in the classroom: Too much background noise.</p>
<p>Things that frustrate me in the classroom: People being disrespectful.</p>
<p>Things that annoy me about group work: The work is not always equal.</p>
<p>Things that keep me from getting my homework done: Procrastination and being busy with other things.</p>
<p>Situations that will make me angry: Not many... Maybe being accused of something.</p>
<p>Situations that will make me shut-down: Being overwhelmed by the amount of work.</p>
