## Feedback
<p>I prefer to receive feedback: In all ways.</p>
<p>If you are going to correct me: Do it Anytime when needed.</p>
<p>If you are going to tell me I'm doing something wrong, phrase it this way: However you want.</p>
<p>If you want to praise me: Any.</p>
<p>It is important to me that feedback is: Useful.</p>
